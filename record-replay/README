Prerequisites:
=============
1. DMTCP sources must be present in order to compile the module. They are not
   needed to use the module.
2. Requires DMTCP revision 1956+.

Build:
======
To compile the module, put the appropriate path to dmtcp trunk in the following
command:
./configure --with-dmtcp-path=/path/to/dmtcp/trunk

Run:
====
To use thie module with DMTCP, provide the _absolute_ path to fredhijack.so on
the dmtcp_checkpoint command line as follows:

./bin/dmtcp_checkpoint --with-module /path/to/fredhijack.so \
  gdb ../pthread-wrappers/test-programs/pthread-test

This module should be the first one in DMTCP module sequence provided by
--with-module (or equivalent) in order to assure proper record/replay.
